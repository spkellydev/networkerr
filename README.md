# networkerr
A web application to find email addresses from company URLs and social media accounts attached to those emails. The intent of this project was to create an easy to use interface for conducting research on contacts within a company before getting on a phone interview. Networkerr uses a NodeJS backend and the NoSQL database, MongoDB. This project uses the Handlebars front end framework and templating engine.

## Running this application
`npm start` will launch the application on the selected port, which can be accessed through localhost. Simply add a URL of a company and Networkerr will search through the Hunter.io and Full Contact APIs to provide information about your chosen company's contacts.
